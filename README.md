Deep Learning and Statistical Analysis for Area-Based PM2.5 Forecasting in Hat Yai: A Pilot Study

Abstact:

PM2.5 pollution is a major concern in Southeast Asia, including Thailand, significantly impacting both environmental and human health. This study focuses on area-based forecasting of PM2.5 concentrations in Hat Yai city, Songkhla province, using data from 2013 to 2023 collected at the local Hat Yai station. We developed and evaluated forecasting models employing Deep Learning and Machine Learning techniques, enhanced by statistical tools for performance analysis. The ConvLSTM1D-BiLSTM model, optimized with a 7-input window, 1-output window, and 6 strides, emerged as the most effective, achieving a mean MAE of 2.11 and a mean R2 score of 0.64. In PM2.5 level classification, it reached macro average sensitivity and F1 scores of 0.79 and 0.78, respectively. External validation with data from four nearby stations further demonstrated the model's effectiveness, yielding a mean MAE of 2.57. The results of this pilot study highlight the robustness of our method, paving the way for its practical application in similar settings.
